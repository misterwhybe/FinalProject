# How happy are we really?
By: Wiebe Jelsma
Create the map of europe with different levels of happiness for each country. Specify which year or country you want to see. Each colour is a different level (0-10) to show how it changed in less-developed countries. 

## Problem statement:
A lot is changing in the world nowadays. A lot of people my age don't even
know how life was when the soviet union was still there.
Europe was divided, but how is it now? I want to show the transition of the happiness
for all of the European countries.
We must realize that we are Europe, and that the countries in Europe are kind of similar.
That is why i want to show that the level of happiness did increase a lot over the last several years.

My map will show the transition in the level of happiness over the years for all european countries.
My map should have different colours for the different levels, and it's a map of Europe.
we start like 20 years ago, and slowely the years will increase and thereby the colours will change.
I think that first we will see a lot of difference between eastern and western Europe, but this difference will be decreasing.
you can select specific years to compare scores of countries.
If you specify a country, you can see the different levels over the years.

## MVP:
Having the map of Europe, have different colours for the levels of happiness.
Being able to control the specific years so you can compare other countries.
Selecting countries to have a history of the happiness.

### Extra:
moving cursor over countries to get the level of happiness.

### Visual Scetch:

I wont be using gender but years.

### Prerequisites:
Data source: European Social Survey. Every 2 years they conduct surveys to determine a lot of things in a country,
one of them is the happiness. With this i can deduct the score. https://www.europeansocialsurvey.org/data/country_index.html
It starts in 2002. I can download the data into an SPSS file. There, I either calculate the level of happiness and put
the score into an excel file, or see if i can put it in an excel file already.
If that would be difficult, i would use something like this. https://www.kaggle.com/unsdsn/world-happiness. 
This is only for the last 3 years, but i'm sure i can find more.

### External Compounts: 
No idea yet.

### Review:
https://ourworldindata.org/happiness-and-life-satisfaction
This is what i want to do!

### Hardest parts:
I think specifying the country and then getting a history of the levels is pretty difficult. Also, with the moving cursor to get the level of happiness can be very difficult. Also, not all countries participated every time so there is a lack of data sometimes.

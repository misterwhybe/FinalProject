# How happy are we really?
By: Wiebe Jelsma.
Create the map of the World with different levels of happiness for each country. Specify which year or country you want to see. Each colour is a different level (0-10) to show how it changed in less-developed countries.
I will use the World Happiness Report. I will download the report of 2018, because it contains the years 2005-2017 per country. 
http://worldhappiness.report/download/
Hereby, i can specify which country has which happiness score in which year. The item I will use is the Life ladder. It asks respondents to think of a ladder, with the best possible life for them being a 10, and the worst possible life being a 0. They are then asked to rate their own current lives on that 0 to 10 scale. This will give a mean per year per country.

## Problem statement:
The whole world is changing all the time. We must not forget that countries change a lot, and underdeveloped countries might be completely different 10 years later. 

My map will show the transition in the level of happiness over the years for all countries.
My map should have different colours for the different levels, and it's a map of the World.
We start like 10 years ago, and slowely the years will increase and thereby the colours will change.
I think that first we will see a lot of difference between eastern and western countries, but this difference will be decreasing.
You can select specific years to compare scores of countries.
If you specify a country, you can see the different levels over the years.

## MVP:
Having the map, have different colours for the levels of happiness.
Being able to control the specific years so you can compare other countries.
Selecting countries to have a history of the happiness.

### Extra:
Moving cursor over countries to get the level of happiness.

### Visual Scetch:
![doc/scetch](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44019712/48985304-5d2b0b80-f106-11e8-896c-b6a96508c6b8.jpg)
I wont be using gender but years.

### Prerequisites:
I will get the data from http://worldhappiness.report/download/. Here, we can get the years 2005-2017 per country. 
I will use a map or the world from http://datamaps.github.io/.
The other dataset i will be using is the amount of cannabis is used per country https://dataunodc.un.org/drugs/prevalence_table.
Hereby, we can see if there is a correlation between the happiness level and the usage of cannabis. 

### External Compounts: 
No idea yet.

### Review:
https://ourworldindata.org/happiness-and-life-satisfaction
This is what i want to do!

### Hardest parts:
I think specifying the country and then getting a history of the levels is pretty difficult. Also, with the moving cursor to get the level of happiness can be very difficult. Also, not all countries participated every time so there is a lack of data sometimes.

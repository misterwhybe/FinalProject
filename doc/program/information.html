        This webpage shows the average score of the life ladder per country. 
        What is a life ladder? According to the World Happiness Report, a life 
        ladder is used when respondents are asked to think of a ladder, with the
        best possible life for them being a 10, and the worst possible life 
        being a 0. They are then asked to rate their own current lives on that
        0 to 10 scale. With a life ladder we can see how residents experience
        their own life. <br>keep in mind: this is subjective and we can never 
        be sure if these numbers are representative.

        The colours represent a certain average. Click a country and a bar chart
        will show. Here, you can see the average of that specific country over 
        the last years. If a certain year doesn't have a bar, there wasn't any 
        data from this year. Hover over the bar to see it's value.
        After you clicked a country, a pie chart will also show. Here, you can see 
        how many people died in that country as a result of drugs and alcohol. 
        Use the slider next to it to select the year you want to see.

        <p>
            A bar chart consists of several bars. Here, it contains the average
            score for the life ladder. It only shows one country, the country 
            you clicked on. If you click another country, this bar chart will 
            go away and a new one will take its place. It shows the years 
            2005-2016. Sometimes, a certain year is empty. This means there
            is no data available for this year. The colour of the bars is 
            the same as the legend of the worldmap, so the higher the score 
            the higher the score (from lightgreen to darkgreen)

                After a country is clicked, a pie chart will be shown on the 
                right. This pie chart shows us the amount of deaths in that 
                country which are related to drugs and alcohol. A slider is 
                available under the world map. Use this slider to select 
                which year you want to see. The standard year is 1990. Take 
                the slider and move it!

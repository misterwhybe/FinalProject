        Life Ladder

        This webpage shows the average score of the life ladder per country. 
        What is a life ladder? According to the World Happiness Report, a life 
        ladder is used when respondents are asked to think of a ladder, with 
        the best possible life for them being a 10, and the worst possible life
         being a 0. They are then asked to rate their own current lives on that
        0 to 10 scale. With a life ladder we can see how residents experience
        their own life. Hover over a country to see the average life ladder.
        <br>Keep in mind: this is subjective and we can never 
        be sure if these numbers are representative.

        <p ALIGN = LEFT>
        After you click on a country, a pie chart will also be shown. This pie 
        chart will show how many people died in that specified country related 
        to drugs and alcohol. Click the button to go to the source. The problem
         with this dataset is that it contains the amount of deaths per year 
        per country, and the numbers have a lot of decimals. You would think 
        that the deaths will be a whole number, and not a float. Therefore, the
         number shown is rounded.

          Bar Chart
        </h2>
        <p>
          A bar chart consists of several bars. Here, it contains the average
          score for the life ladder. It only shows the one country you  
          clicked on. If you click another country, this bar chart will 
          disappear and a new one will take its place. It shows the years 
          2005-2016. A missing bar means there is no data available for this 
          year. The colour of the bars is 
          the same as the worldmap legend, so the denser the colour 
          the higher the score (ranging from lightgreen to darkgreen).
          Hover over a bar and it will show it's value!

          After a country is clicked, a pie chart will be shown on the 
          right. This pie chart shows the amount of deaths in that 
          country which are related to drugs and alcohol. A slider is 
          available under the world map. Use this slider to select 
          which year you want to see. The standard year is 1990. Take 
          the slider and move it!
